# Soul-Fighter-Gwen-Scissor
The code for my Soul Fighter Gwen 3D model to go with a future 3D model !!!

I will update this more in the future when I finish my version of the prop. But please read the code top to bottom before modifying changes to it if you are new to LED programming. I added little comments to help you identify what to change. 

You will need a board and a power boost in order to operate large numbers of LEDs. 

I used a KB2040 from Adafruit and a powerboost 1000C for this project. 

Happy making!!
